Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::reCAPTCHA
=========================================

This is Catalyst::Controller::reCAPTCHA (http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Controller-reCAPTCHA/)
as a controller role instead of a base controller.

Using this role, you get auto-ssl support and you can pass custom options to the Captcha::reCAPTCHA
wrapped object.
